Homework 3 Requirements:

Quicksand font (you will need to use a Google Fonts link) with sans-serif fallback

Header 1 should be 2em, each line should be 1.5 height, and dark red (#c12258)

Paragraphs should be “black”, 18px, with 15px of padding on the top only

Links should be 18px, dark red (#c12258), with an underline

Focused elements should have a 1px “red” border (make sure you format parameters as ‘px, weight, color’ order)

Page background should use the provided image as a non-repeating background, with a fallback color of light grey (#dddddd)

Table should have the following styles:

Table has 2px black border (make sure you format parameters as ‘px, weight, color’ order)

Column headers are always at least 150px wide, with 10px of padding. Column header text is white, centered, and uppercase with a dark 
red background (#7e0830).

Table cells have centered text with a 2px black border on only one side. 

Row headers have a 2px black border that matches the rest of the rows.

Every even numbered table row has a grey background (#dddddd), every add table row has a transparent background.

Hovering over a row changes the background color to light red (#fab9cf).

Table should have only exterior rounded corners


Outside corners of the table are rounded with 10px radius (you need extra code to make sure only the *outside* borders are rounded, not 
all of the cells)

HINT: You will need to round the corners of the table AND the corner cells. How can you use psudeoclasses to make sure the outer cells 
are rounded no matter how big the table is?

Footer has the following styles:

Footer has “white” text on a “black” background

Is always located at the bottom of the browser window, no matter how small the page content is. (this may take more than one line of 
code)
